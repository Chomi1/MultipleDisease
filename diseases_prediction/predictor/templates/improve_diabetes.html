      <ul>
        <li><strong>Medication Adherence:</strong> If your doctor has prescribed medications such as blood thinners, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or statins, make sure to take them as directed.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthy Diet:</strong> Follow a heart-healthy diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats like those found in nuts, seeds, and olive oil. Limit your intake of saturated fats, trans fats, cholesterol, sodium, and added sugars.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Exercise:</strong> Engage in regular physical activity as recommended by your healthcare provider. Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity exercise per week, along with muscle-strengthening activities on two or more days per week.</li>
        <li><strong>Weight Management:</strong> Maintain a healthy weight or work towards achieving a healthy weight if you are overweight or obese. Losing even a small amount of weight can significantly improve heart health.</li>
        <li><strong>Quit Smoking:</strong> If you smoke, quit smoking as soon as possible. Smoking is a major risk factor for heart disease and quitting can significantly reduce your risk of heart-related complications.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Alcohol Intake:</strong> If you drink alcohol, do so in moderation. Limiting alcohol consumption can help reduce your risk of developing heart disease and other health problems.</li>
        <li><strong>Manage Stress:</strong> Practice stress-reduction techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, yoga, or spending time on hobbies and activities that you enjoy.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Blood Pressure and Cholesterol:</strong> Keep track of your blood pressure and cholesterol levels regularly, as recommended by your healthcare provider. High blood pressure and high cholesterol are major risk factors for heart disease.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Quality Sleep:</strong> Aim for 7-9 hours of quality sleep per night. Poor sleep quality and sleep disorders can contribute to heart disease risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Follow Up with Healthcare Provider:</strong> Attend regular follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to monitor your condition, adjust medications if necessary, and address any concerns or questions you may have.</li>
    </ul>
